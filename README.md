# RFC822/2822_sanitizer

This is a fork of the [rfc822_sanitizer](https://crates.io/crates/rfc822_sanitizer) crate ([repo](https://gitlab.com/alatiera/rfc822_sanitizer)), which updates a couple of the dependencies to their newer (and stable) versions. The crate appears not to be receiving future updates at this point; however, you should check there first to see if the official crate does what you need. All credit for the code goes to the original author.
